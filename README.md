# KNN-and-Naive-Bayes-Classifier

## **Description**
This project requires us to implement a K-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier  and a Naive Bayes classifier. 
* K-nearest neighbor (kNN)
  For this classification project, we are provided with the titanic dataset to determine whether a passenger survives or not

* Naive Bayes classifier
  For this classification project, we are provided with spambase dataset to determine whether an email is spam or not

**Research Question**

* Build a K Nearest Neighbour model that determines whether a titanic passenger survives or not.
* Build a Naive Bayes Model that determines whether an email is spam or not

## **Technologies**
Project was created with:
* Google Colab
* Python
* Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib libraries
* Sklearn

## **Dataset**
* Titanic Dataset [Link](https://archive.org/download/train5_202002/train%20%285%29.csv)
* Spambase dataset [Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase)
